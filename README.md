## Correction

This code assumes that the uncertainty column in the Berkeley Land and
Ocean summary provides the standard deviation of the global mean temperatures.

According to
<http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/auto/Global/Land_and_Ocean_summary.txt>
"Uncertainties represent the 95% confidence % interval for statistical
and spatial undersampling effects as well as ocean biases."

We recommended the uncertainty values by 1.96 to obtain the standard
error for the global mean temperatures.
